### Overview

Welcome to **ETCD V3 EDITOR**, an open-source full-stack application designed for efficiency and scalability! The backend
is powered by **go-zero**, a high-performance microservices framework, while the frontend is built with **Ant Design Pro
**, delivering a modern and intuitive user interface. Whether you're a developer or contributor, we‚Äôre excited to have
you onboard!

### Features

- **Backend**: Built with go-zero, featuring a custom response structure (
  see [go-zero docs](https://go-zero.dev/docs/tutorials/cli/template)).
- **Frontend**: Powered by Ant Design Pro for a sleek, responsive UI.
- **Deployment Options**: Supports standalone frontend-backend separation, Docker, and Electron.
- **Embedded Build**: Run `yarn spa` to compile the frontend, which gets embedded into the backend at
  `backend/etc/dist`.
- **Configuration**: Backend config files located at `backend/etc`. Default credentials: `admin` / `admin`. you can modify 
the configuration file according your needs. the notes are chinese only . but it's easy and simple .such :

```yaml
